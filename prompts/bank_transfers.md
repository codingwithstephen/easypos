# Bank Transfers Implementation Guide

This document outlines the steps required to implement automatic bank transfers in the EasyPOS application using the Stripe API. Follow this task list to set up the functionality that allows users to enter their bank details and automatically transfer payments to their bank accounts.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] Stripe account (create one at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com) if you don't have one)
- [ ] Basic understanding of React Native and JavaScript
- [ ] Node.js and npm installed on your development machine

## Task List

### 1. Set Up Stripe Account and API Keys

- [x] Create a Stripe account at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
- [x] Navigate to the Stripe Dashboard
- [x] Go to Developers > API keys
- [ ] Make note of your Publishable key and Secret key
- [ ] Enable Connect functionality in your Stripe account (for direct bank transfers)

### 2. Install Required Dependencies

- [ ] Install Stripe React Native SDK:
  ```bash
  npm install @stripe/stripe-react-native
  ```
- [ ] Install AsyncStorage if not already installed:
  ```bash
  npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage
  ```
- [ ] Link native dependencies:
  ```bash
  npx pod-install ios
  # or for Android
  npx react-native link
  ```

### 3. Configure Stripe in Your Application

- [ ] Create a .env file to store your Stripe API keys securely
- [ ] Set up environment variables for Stripe API keys
- [ ] Initialize Stripe in your app:
  ```javascript
  import { StripeProvider } from '@stripe/stripe-react-native';

  // In your App component
  <StripeProvider
    publishableKey="pk_test_your_publishable_key"
    merchantIdentifier="your_merchant_identifier" // for Apple Pay
  >
    {/* Your app components */}
  </StripeProvider>
  ```

### 4. Update User Data Structure

- [ ] Modify the user data structure to include bank account information:
  ```javascript
  const newUser = {
    username,
    password,
    merchantName,
    bankAccount: {
      accountName: '',
      accountNumber: '',
      routingNumber: '',
      connected: false,
      autoTransfer: false,
      transferFrequency: 'daily', // Options: daily, weekly, monthly
    },
  };
  ```

### 5. Create Bank Account Setup UI

- [ ] Add state variables for bank account information:
  ```javascript
  const [bankAccountName, setBankAccountName] = useState('');
  const [bankAccountNumber, setBankAccountNumber] = useState('');
  const [bankRoutingNumber, setBankRoutingNumber] = useState('');
  const [enableAutoTransfer, setEnableAutoTransfer] = useState(false);
  const [transferFrequency, setTransferFrequency] = useState('daily');
  const [hasBankAccount, setHasBankAccount] = useState(false);
  const [showBankAccountSetup, setShowBankAccountSetup] = useState(false);
  ```
- [ ] Create a bank account setup screen component
- [ ] Add form fields for bank account details
- [ ] Add toggle for enabling automatic transfers
- [ ] Add dropdown for transfer frequency selection
- [ ] Implement form validation for bank details

### 6. Connect Bank Account to Stripe

- [ ] Create a function to handle bank account submission
- [ ] Implement Stripe API call to create a bank account token:
  ```javascript
  const { token, error } = await stripe.createTokenForBankAccount({
    accountHolderName: bankAccountName,
    accountNumber: bankAccountNumber,
    routingNumber: bankRoutingNumber,
    country: 'US', // Change based on your country
    currency: 'usd', // Change based on your currency
  });
  ```
- [ ] Set up a backend endpoint to securely handle the token
- [ ] Create a Stripe Connect account for the user
- [ ] Link the bank account to the Stripe Connect account
- [ ] Store the Stripe account ID in your user data

### 7. Implement Automatic Transfer Logic

- [ ] Modify the payment processing function to check for auto-transfer setting
- [ ] Create a function to initiate transfer after payment:
  ```javascript
  const handleTransferToBank = async (paymentIntent) => {
    if (currentUser?.bankAccount?.autoTransfer) {
      // Call your backend to initiate transfer
      const response = await fetch('your-backend-url/api/transfer', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: {
          'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          userId: currentUser.id,
          paymentId: paymentIntent.id,
          amount: paymentIntent.amount,
        }),
      });

      const result = await response.json();
      if (result.success) {
        // Show success message
      }
    }
  };
  ```
- [ ] Set up a backend endpoint to handle transfer requests
- [ ] Implement Stripe transfer API call on the backend:
  ```javascript
  // Backend code (Node.js example)
  const transfer = await stripe.transfers.create({
    amount: amount,
    currency: 'usd',
    destination: userStripeAccountId,
    source_transaction: paymentId,
  });
  ```

### 8. Set Up Scheduled Transfers (Optional)

- [ ] Create a backend service for scheduled transfers
- [ ] Set up a cron job or scheduled function based on transfer frequency
- [ ] Implement logic to batch transfers for efficiency
- [ ] Add notification system for transfer status updates

### 9. Update Payment Confirmation UI

- [ ] Modify the payment confirmation screen to show transfer status
- [ ] Add option to manually transfer if auto-transfer is disabled
- [ ] Display bank account information (last 4 digits only)
- [ ] Show estimated arrival time for the transfer

### 10. Test Implementation

- [ ] Test bank account setup with Stripe test mode
- [ ] Test payment processing with test cards
- [ ] Test automatic transfers to ensure they work correctly
- [ ] Verify transfer appears in Stripe dashboard
- [ ] Test edge cases (insufficient funds, invalid bank details, etc.)

### 11. Security Considerations

- [ ] Ensure all API keys are properly secured
- [ ] Implement proper error handling for all API calls
- [ ] Use HTTPS for all network requests
- [ ] Only store necessary bank information (mask account numbers)
- [ ] Comply with PCI DSS requirements for handling payment information

## Implementation Notes

- Always use Stripe's test mode during development
- Consider implementing a webhook handler for asynchronous events
- Monitor transfer failures and implement retry logic
- Keep users informed about the status of their transfers
- Consider adding a transfer history feature for transparency
